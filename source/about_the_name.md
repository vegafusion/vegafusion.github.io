# About the name
There are two meanings behind the name "VegaFusion"
 - It's a nod to the [Apache Arrow DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) library which is used to implement many of the supported Vega transforms
 - Vega and Altair are named after stars, and stars are powered by nuclear fusion
