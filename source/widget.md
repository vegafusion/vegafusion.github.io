# VegaFusionWidget
The VegaFusion widget renderer uses the `vegafusion.jupyter.VegaFusionWidget` widget class to display charts and maintain a live connection between the Python kernel and the chart in the browser.  This class can also be used directly in order to combine VegaFusion Altair charts with other Jupyter Widgets in larger [layouts](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.3/examples/Widget%20Styling.html).
