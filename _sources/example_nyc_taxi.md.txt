# 10 Million Taxi Rides
This example creates a dashboard to explore 10 million taxi rides in New York City from January 2015.  It supports zoom-based rasterization of the pickup locations, and combines that with cross filtering across a histogram of trip distances and a heatmap of tip rate by hour and day of the week.

See the [PyViz documentation example](https://examples.pyviz.org/nyc_taxi/nyc_taxi.html) for more information on the dataset.
